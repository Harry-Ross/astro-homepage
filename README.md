# Hi there - welcome to my personal site built w/ Astro + TailwindCSS!

I thought this would be a great way to see how I can use Astro to build high quality static sites, without the overhead of NextJS. I also think that the Islands Architecture is a really interesting concept - that your web apps can be framework agnostic - and performant!

To run the project in a dev environment run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
